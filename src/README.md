My Stock Simulator

## Overview
I wanted to make a website where a user could take a stock that gives a dividend undetermined how many shares of that stock they would have after reinvesting the dividends for so many years as well as the overall value of their position. This website will be able to give users the ability to create a portfolio of different positions and allow them to project the value of that portfolio out a given number of years.
I have seen other sites where users can determine the amount of income given by dividends, but these sites only allow a user to determine this based on static values and do not allow projection into the future.
